<p>I came back from the Barcelona Ruby Conference (2014) last week, and since then I’ve been reflecting on the experience. I want to share some insights I came away with, and some of the great times that I had there.</p>

<p>The conference took place over Friday and Saturday at the modern AXA Auditorium, located in the Eixample district of Barcelona. I stayed in Gràcia, an amazing neighborhood with loads of cool bars, coffee shops, and great shops to browse. It’s outside the standard tourist areas (Rambla, Gotic, etc.), and definitely worth a visit.</p>

<p>The organizers did a great job of creating a unique mood for the conference. From the amazing artwork of Silvia Brujas on the conference literature, paraphernalia, and the poster at the entrance to the conference (check out the Baruco website — <a href='http://www.baruco.org/'>http://www.baruco.org/</a>), to the soundscapes that played between presentations that still give me the chills, the atmosphere was definitely stimulating.</p>

<p>Over the course of the two days I met some amazing developers and heard lectures from some really interesting people. The lectures ranged from the more theoretical (Brian Shirai’s ‘Types as Premature Optimization’), to anecdotal (‘How I built my own Twitch-Plays-Pokémon’ by José Albornoz), to some really practical ones (Julian Cheal’s ‘Dancing with Robots’, where Julian controlled a drone using a Dance Dance Revolution mat. Highly recommended!) It was a good range of topics, although I didn’t enjoy all of the lectures.</p>

<p>One lecture that did stand out for me was Erik Michaels-Ober’s ‘Writing Fast Ruby’, where he benchmarked a series of common ruby commands, finding faster ways of doing many every-day things (see his slide deck here). It was really a pleasure to watch — his slides were professionally illustrated, including heart-warming renderings of Don Knuth and Matz as a knowing turtle and a wise cat, and he’s just a great, upbeat guy to listen to. Check out his slides here (from <a href="https://speakerdeck.com/sferik/writing-fast-ruby">Speakerdeck.com</a>):</p>

<p><script async class="speakerdeck-embed" data-id="585245d01ee1013238737e42b879906f" data-ratio="1.77777777777778" src="http://speakerdeck.com/assets/embed.js"></script><br></p>

<p>What inspired me most in the conference was probably some career advice that I received from Pat Shaughnessy. As he has over 20 years of professional developing experience, I asked him for advice on moving forward as a developer, and he told me that a great way to become a stronger developer is to learn from others and work together with others — to not program in a bubble. This message really hit home when I discovered the astounding number of open-source gems that Erik Michaels-Ober actively maintains.</p>

<p>It was also really great seeing the diversity that’s out there among developers. Leon Gersing (Github) gave an inspiring lecture on ‘Keeping Software Weird’, which was about staying true to yourself and breaking rules (see an older version here <a href='http://vimeo.com/54042336Overall'>http://vimeo.com/54042336Overall</a>).</p>

<p>Overall, it was really nice hanging out with people who do the same thing that you do, day in and day out, face the same issues, and share your passion. And it was great seeing how programmers had taken their skills and used them for all sorts of great things — like Europe’s code week, open-source projects, and just having fun building things. I didn’t find that I picked up too many new Ruby skills over the conference, but I did leave having met a lot of amazing people and feeling inspired.</p>
