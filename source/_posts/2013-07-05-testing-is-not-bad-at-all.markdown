Last week I bought the "[Everyday Rails Testing with Rspec](https://leanpub.com/everydayrailsrspec)" book by Aaron Sumner for the third Ruby on Rails course by the TeaLeaf Academy (which, by the way, is a lot of fun!). I expected testing to be a bit of a chore, but it turns out that I'm actually enjoying it.

The course introduces testing very gradually, so that in each exercise you just focus on one or two tests. It's basically breaking up a new skill into edible chunks so that you can really focus on each chunk and process it properly until you understand it. Testing presents kind of a fun brain challenge, figuring out exactly which cases you want to test for and how to most accurately test for these cases, and at the same time it gives you a better understanding of what's going on in your own app.
