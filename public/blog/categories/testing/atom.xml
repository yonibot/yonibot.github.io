    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Last week I bought the &ldquo;<a href="https://leanpub.com/everydayrailsrspec">Everyday Rails Testing with Rspec</a>&rdquo; book by Aaron Sumner for the third Ruby on Rails course by the TeaLeaf Academy (which, by the way, is a lot of fun!). I expected testing to be a bit of a chore, but it turns out that I&rsquo;m actually enjoying it.</p>

<p>The course introduces testing very gradually, so that in each exercise you just focus on one or two tests. It&rsquo;s basically breaking up a new skill into edible chunks so that you can really focus on each chunk and process it properly until you understand it. Testing presents kind of a fun brain challenge, figuring out exactly which cases you want to test for and how to most accurately test for these cases, and at the same time it gives you a better understanding of what&rsquo;s going on in your own app.</p>
